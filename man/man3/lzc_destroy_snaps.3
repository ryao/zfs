.TH lzc_destroy_snaps 3 "2015 JUL 7" "OpenZFS" "OpenZFS Programmer's Manual"

.SH PROLOG
This manual page is part of the OpenZFS Programmer's Manual.

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libzfs_core.h>

\fBint\fR \fBlzc_destroy_snaps\fR(\fBnvlist_t *\fR\fIsnaps\fR, \fBboolean_t\fR \fIdefer\fR, \fBnvlist_t **\fR\fIerrlist\fR);

.SH NAME
lzc_destroy_snaps \- Destroy snapshots

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBlzc_destroy_snaps\fR() function destroys snapshots specified via strings
through the nvlist \fRsnaps\fR. They must all be in the same pool.
.sp
Snapshots that do not exist will be silently ignored.
.sp
If \fIdefer\fR is not set, and a snapshot has user holds or clones, the
destroy operation will fail and none of the snapshots will be
destroyed.
.sp
If \fIdefer\fR is set, and a snapshot has user holds or clones, it will be
marked for deferred destruction, and will be destroyed when the last hold
or clone is removed/destroyed.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. This means that all snapshots were
destroyed (excluding those that did not exist) or were marked for later
distruction if \fIdefer\fR is set.
.sp
On error, an error is returned from one of the snapshots where an error
occurred and \fIerrlist\fR is populated with more specific information if a
pointer is provided. \fIerrlist\fR shall contain keys with the snapshot names
and int32 values of the error codes. The caller must call \fBnvlist_free\fR()
on \fIerrlist\fR if this occurs.
.SH ERRORS
