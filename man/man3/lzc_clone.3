.SH PROLOG
This manual page is part of the OpenZFS Programmer's Manual.

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libzfs_core.h>

\fBint\fR \fBlzc_clone\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIfsname\fR, \fBconst char *\fR \fIorigin\fR, \fBnvlist_t *\fR\fIprops\fR);

.SH NAME
lzc_clone \- Creates a clone from a snapshot

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
\fBlibzfs_clone\fR()
function creates a ZFS dataset or volume named
.I fsname
from the snapshot
.fs origin .
Properties may optionally be set using
.I props .

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, an error is returned.
.SH ERRORS

.LP
The \fBlzc_clone()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEDQUOT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n

quota.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEEXIST\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n

.sp
A dataset named \fIfsname\fR already exists.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
The dataset name \fIfsname\fR is not syntactically correct. This includes situations where bookmarks, snapshots or holds are specified.
.sp
